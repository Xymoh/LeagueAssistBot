# LeagueAssistBot
Bot for assisting League of Legends players !! under development !!

I'm making Bot with multifunctional commands.

Commands:
- $level "nickname" - to check level of a user
- $addPoints "nickname" *command free only for admin* - to add level to a user
- $help - to gather information about bot (just to edit string with completed information)
- $ranking - to check the ranking of players who has the biggest rank in the game *for now it's only doable through adding users as a raw method through the code. In the future there will be commands $add and $delete to manage the list those commands will be available only for admin usage.
- $select - to randomize what gamestyle of the league we should play

So far this bot can do:
- connect to whatever server of discord
- invoke the commands by first sign $
- randomize a choice of what game type u should play in league
- leveling system (to be added the time limiter of gaining experience)
- check the current level of certain user
- add experience points for leveling up
- view the ranking of the players (only added by a raw method of the code, in the future to be added command $add and $delete to manage the ranking of players)
- send the private message to the user who uses command

TO BE ADDED:
- $image "champion" - random generation of images of a certain champion
- $add - adding a user to a ranking
- $delete - deleting user from a ranking
- $build "champion" - info about what runes and build is recommended for a champion
- $profile "nickname" - info about a certain profile

rest possible commands possible after development of a bot and user suggestions.
